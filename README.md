# Diagnosis-of-Polycystic-Ovary-Syndrome-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-

This project applies machine learning algorithms to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) based on clinical and lifestyle data. The goal is to build predictive models that can identify PCOS risk patterns and support healthcare professionals in decision-making.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature selection from medical datasets

Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

Model performance comparison and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of important features influencing PCOS prediction

Insights to support data-driven medical analysis
